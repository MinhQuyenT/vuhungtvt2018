<h1 align="center"> Hello, I'm Duong Vu Hung 👋 </h1>
<h3 align="center">🚀 Machien Vision Engineer 🚀</h3>
</br></br></br>
I am a Machine Vision Engineer. I graduated from Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology.
I want to apply image processing and deep learning to solve problems in the production line. Helps businesses increase production capacity and revenue. 🚀
I am a 4th Year undergraduate student from Manipal University Jaipur. From very early on in my life, I started to fall in love with technology 😍 This love has helped me develop a very good technological mindset , and given me the curiosity to learn more. I firmly believe that no amount of knowledge  is enough knowledge. 🧠

### Here are some ideas to get you started:</br>
- 🔭 I’m currently more into the **AI and Machine Vision**
- 🌱 I’m currently learning **Open Source Contribution.**
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on: **Developing new and intriguing Machine Vision projects, with the community, for the community**
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with **again Open Source. This is really fun.**
- 💬 Ask me about **Technology, Aviation, Troubleshooting, Psychology, Neuroscience, History, Nature.**
- ⚡ Fun fact: **The first message sent over the internet was "LOG". "LOGIN" was the original intended message but the entire system crashed. This was done at MIT.**
